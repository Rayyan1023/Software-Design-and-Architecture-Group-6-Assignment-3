Exercise 1:
Because each View operator has an instance variable in the Cash Register class, the first solution is simple to construct but complicated to modify.

Exercise 2:
The second exercise is simpler to integrate than the first since the CashRegister does not have to rely on the View classes' operators.
AlALthough, because the View classes still include instance variables, the Cash Register class is still reliant on it.

Exercise 3:
This method is simple to extend since you may construct a new class that implements observerRegister without changing CashRegister, and so Cash Register isn't reliant of any operator.
